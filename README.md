> deletescape scripts

This is nothing more than just a collection of scripts that have been useful to me. This doesn't mean that they will be useful for you too, or that I would help you with how to use them.

To be able to properly run the scripts in this repo make sure to add the directory you cloned this into to your `PATH`.

## Setup

To install the requirements for all scripts simply run `dsetup`.
